            def readable_timedelta(days):
              # insert your docstring here
              

              weeks = days // 7
              remainder = days % 7
              return "{} week(s) and {} day(s)".format(weeks, remainder)
 
question  9 : write a function to calculate the volume of a cyclinder



###NEW QUESTIONS
## question 1: Your code should check if each number in the list is a prime number
check_prime = [26, 39, 51, 53, 57, 79, 85]

# question 2
Write a Python program to convert them into a dictionary in a way that item from list1 is the key and item from list2 is the value

keys = ['Ten', 'Twenty', 'Thirty']
values = [10, 20, 30]

## question 3
Print the value of key ‘history’ from the below dict
sampleDict = {
    "class": {
        "student": {
            "name": "Mike",
            "marks": {
                "physics": 70,
                "history": 80
            }
        }
    }
}
## question 4
Write a program to accept a number from a user and calculate the sum of all numbers from 1 to a given number

For example, if the user entered 10 the output should be 55 (1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+10)

# TODO 
## question 5
Write a program to print multiplication table of a given number
For example, num = 2 so the output should be

### 2
### 4
### 6
### 8
### 10
### 12
### 14
### 16
### 18
### 20

## question 6
Write a program to display only those numbers from a list that satisfy the following conditions

The number must be divisible by five
If the number is greater than 150, then skip it and move to the next number
If the number is greater than 500, then stop the loop
Given:
numbers = [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]

## question 7
write a program to calculate the cube of all numbers from 1 to a given number

Given:

input_number = 6


## question 7

Use the print() function to format the given words in the mentioned format. Display the ** separator between each string.

Expected Output:
For example: print('Name', 'Is', 'James') will display Name**Is**James
